# ATLAS
ATLAS is a website that aims to inspire artists who are struggling to come up with new ideas for their next art piece. It also provides easy access to a database of free copyrighted images to help the artist visualize and come out of the artist's block they are stuck at. ATLAS uses AI to anylize the artist's work and predict their style and the pose of the character in the art piece. ATLAS then offers free copyrighted reference images to artists based on previously uploaded art to ATLAS by the artist and specifically based on the poses of the characters drawn in the art pieces.

The website is deployed using Flask and uses SQLite for the database.
